This may be the most challenging thing I have ever done: writing publicly is something I would never have thought doing because that involves revealing what's inside my head and exposing myself to an audience that may know me but also to many people that don’t.
The whole process is making me uncomfortable as I don’t control the outcome, even though the content is actually mine: it is left to everyone’s perception, appreciation and perspective. There’s nothing I can do about it and I’m kind of OK with it. Some will feel they can relate to what is written, some might say it’s bad, while some may just not care at all. That’s great, but it is however not the reason I’m doing it.

There is this sentence I often used: I’m a better coach than an athlete. Added to the fact I also consider myself a better listener/reader that I am a story teller, that means I'd rather help someone with their own blog than doing mine. Still, here I am starting all of this. Crazy times.
I recall I originally thought this process of writing would be simpler: doing it and publishing, boom, done. The thing is, It is not only putting words after words and construct sentences but structure them in a way such as it tells a story, is smooth and easy to read. 
I’m doing it because after almost 30 years walking this Earth, I’ve learned a lot and continue doing it: about people, interactions, interconnections, sciences, and the list goes on and on.
Don’t get me wrong: I’m still an amateur on many of the topics I worked on. I have a deep and burning desire to ingest, digest and organize this knowledge, and share what I feel legit to write about to as many people as I can. You know, I deeply and genuinely care about people in general. So if there’s anything I can share that might end up helping one of you to live your best life, well, be sure I’ll do my best.

So why did I decided to publish it today, you're wondering? I guess there is never a good moment. The more I think about it, the more I feel I should have done it yesterday, or even the day before. Since I have high standards, I would have decided it would still not be perfect, reworking it again, and again. To the point I would just be procrastinating. If it was really and solely about me, I would have rewritten this entire block of text a million times. I still have to admit I've reworked this text many times, moved paragraphs around, reworked sentences, started to get sidetracked and moved whole chunks of text into their own future thoughts. I just don't feel comfortable anyway with my writing and probably never will, no matter the content and form. They say that starting is the hardest part and then it gets easier and better, right?
So last week, some of my relatives made made accountable to <em>“Just Do It”</em>™. They told me I shouldn’t fear it, be worried about it, that I should just start, and that I could even start with just them. So here I am, finishing this on a Sunday afternoon, refining it as much as I can so that tonight, I publish it. I know for a fact there will be spelling mistakes, or grammar ones, and some might even be rather dumb. Again, it’s all good. I’m a grinder, a “try harder" so I’ll fix them and improve with time. So can everyone.

Writing is not a passion and I'm not sure it will ever be, but I have a good feeling when I’m doing it. It feels rather natural, takes me out of my work, helps me process and organize all of the information that is going a million miles an hour in my brain, and it certainly moves me out of my comfort zone. The last point, which I’ll write about in the future, is something I’m looking forward the most. Short story: Magic always happens outside of your comfort zone. So get out of it, and start living your best life!
Even though all the notes I’m taking and writing down are just premises of what might ultimately be considered a book (or books) on certain topics, I for now don't see a good way to assemble all of these pieces together. As if there was some sort of a process to get through. Maybe it’s about confidence, or experience. Anyway, we’ll see.
